8. Code Generation Specific - Use “leading words” to nudge the model toward a particular pattern
   Less effective ❌:

# Write a simple python function that

# 1. Ask me for a number in mile

# 2. It converts miles to kilometers

In this code example below, adding “import” hints to the model that it should start writing in Python. (Similarly “SELECT” is a good hint for the start of a SQL statement.)

Better ✅:

# Write a simple python function that

# 1. Ask me for a number in mile

# 2. It converts miles to kilometers

import
