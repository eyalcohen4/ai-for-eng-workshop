Let's plan a new software project.
We're going to build a simple stock dashboard, which connects to a server at <URL>/api/getStockMoves.

The application is using Express.js that serves HTML, without client-side javascript.

The purpose of this Dashboard is to view top 10 movers in the last day.

Please draft a planning document outlining the project structure, the necessary components, the interactions between these components, and the sequence of tasks we should follow to complete the project.
