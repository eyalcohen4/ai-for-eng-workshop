# Prompt

We have planned a new software project, a Meetup API. This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Express.js on the Node.js platform. The purpose of this API is to manage meetup events, and we will use an in-memory data store (like an array) to keep it simple.

Our planning document outlines the following project structure:

```plaintext
meetup-api/
|-- node_modules/
|-- routes/
|   |-- meetups.js
|-- index.js
|-- package.json
```

1. `node_modules/`: This is where the dependencies of the project live.
2. `routes/`: This directory contains route definitions, specifically, a `meetups.js` file for handling meetup-related routes.
3. `index.js`: This is the entry point of our application where we set up our Express application and link it to the routes.
4. `package.json`: This file holds various metadata relevant to the project including its dependencies.

Based on this structure and information, could you help generate the basic structure and boilerplate code for this Node.js and Express.js project? 

The boilerplate should include the setup for the Express application, middleware, and the skeleton for the routes mentioned in the planning document. It should include the boilerplate of the route handlers. just the basic route definitions.

# Meetup API - Basic Structure and Boilerplate Code

Here is the basic structure and boilerplate code for your Node.js and Express.js project.

First, you'll need to create your project's folder structure. In your terminal, you can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
mkdir meetup-api
cd meetup-api
mkdir routes
touch index.js routes/meetups.js
```

Next, you'll need to initialize a new Node.js project and install Express.js. In your terminal, run these commands:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install express
```

This will generate the `package.json` file and install Express.js, adding it to your dependencies.

Now you can start creating the boilerplate code:

### index.js

The `index.js` file will setup the Express application and middleware, and link to the routes:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const meetupsRoutes = require("./routes/meetups");
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Express middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Routes
app.use("/meetups", meetupsRoutes);

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
```

### routes/meetups.js

The `routes/meetups.js` file will include the basic route definitions:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

// Route to create a new meetup
router.post("/", (req, res) => {
  // TODO: Implement meetup creation
  res.send("Create a new meetup");
});

// Route to retrieve a list of all meetups
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // TODO: Implement retrieving all meetups
  res.send("List all meetups");
});

// Route to retrieve a specific meetup by its 'id'
router.get("/:id", (req, res) => {
  // TODO: Implement retrieving a specific meetup
  res.send("Get meetup with id " + req.params.id);
});

// Route to update the details of a specific meetup by its 'id'
router.put("/:id", (req, res) => {
  // TODO: Implement updating a specific meetup
  res.send("Update meetup with id " + req.params.id);
});

// Route to delete a specific meetup by its 'id'
router.delete("/:id", (req, res) => {
  // TODO: Implement deleting a specific meetup
  res.send("Delete meetup with id " + req.params.id);
});

module.exports = router;
```

With these files in place, you've now set up the basic structure and boilerplate code for your Meetup API. The next step would be to implement the route handlers, which can be done in the `routes/meetups.js` file.
