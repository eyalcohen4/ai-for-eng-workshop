# Prompt

We have set up the basic structure and boilerplate code for our Meetup API project, a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Express.js on the Node.js platform. The purpose of this API is to manage meetup events and it uses an in-memory data store (like an array).

The boilerplate includes the basic route definitions in the `routes/meetups.js` file, which currently are:

```javascript
router.post("/", (req, res) => {
  // TODO: Implement meetup creation
  res.send("Create a new meetup");
});

router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // TODO: Implement retrieving all meetups
  res.send("List all meetups");
});

router.get("/:id", (req, res) => {
  // TODO: Implement retrieving a specific meetup
  res.send("Get meetup with id " + req.params.id);
});

router.put("/:id", (req, res) => {
  // TODO: Implement updating a specific meetup
  res.send("Update meetup with id " + req.params.id);
});

router.delete("/:id", (req, res) => {
  // TODO: Implement deleting a specific meetup
  res.send("Delete meetup with id " + req.params.id);
});
```

Can you help implement the logic for these route handlers in Node.js and Express.js? 

For the in-memory data store, let's use an array of objects where each object represents a meetup and has an 'id', 'name', 'description', 'location', 'date', and 'time'.

# Meetup API - Implementing Route Handlers

The logic for the route handlers in the `routes/meetups.js` file can be implemented as follows:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

let meetups = []; // In-memory data store
let currentId = 1; // Helper variable to assign IDs to meetups

// Route to create a new meetup
router.post("/", (req, res) => {
  const { name, description, location, date, time } = req.body;
  const newMeetup = {
    id: currentId++,
    name,
    description,
    location,
    date,
    time,
  };
  meetups.push(newMeetup);
  res.status(201).json(newMeetup);
});

// Route to retrieve a list of all meetups
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json(meetups);
});

// Route to retrieve a specific meetup by its 'id'
router.get("/:id", (req, res) => {
  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);
  const meetup = meetups.find((m) => m.id === id);

  if (!meetup) return res.status(404).json({ error: "Meetup not found" });

  res.json(meetup);
});

// Route to update the details of a specific meetup by its 'id'
router.put("/:id", (req, res) => {
  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);
  const index = meetups.findIndex((m) => m.id === id);

  if (index === -1) return res.status(404).json({ error: "Meetup not found" });

  const { name, description, location, date, time } = req.body;
  meetups[index] = { id, name, description, location, date, time };

  res.json(meetups[index]);
});

// Route to delete a specific meetup by its 'id'
router.delete("/:id", (req, res) => {
  const id = parseInt(req.params.id);
  const index = meetups.findIndex((m) => m.id === id);

  if (index === -1) return res.status(404).json({ error: "Meetup not found" });

  meetups = meetups.filter((m) => m.id !== id);

  res.status(204).end();
});

module.exports = router;
```

This code implements the logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting meetups. It uses an array `meetups` as the in-memory data store and a variable `currentId` to assign IDs to the meetups. The `/:id` routes parse the 'id' from the request parameters and find the corresponding meetup in the data store. If a meetup with the specified 'id' cannot be found, these routes respond with a 404 status and an error message.

For creating and updating meetups, the code destructures the properties from the request body and creates/updates a meetup object accordingly. The `POST /` route responds with a 201 status and the created meetup, while the `PUT /:id` route responds with the updated meetup.

The `DELETE /:id` route removes the specified meetup from the data store and responds with a 204 status, indicating that the request has been successfully processed and there is no additional content to send in the response body.
