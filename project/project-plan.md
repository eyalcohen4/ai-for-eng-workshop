# Meetup API Planning Document

## Project Overview

The Meetup API is a Node.js application that utilizes the Express.js framework to implement a RESTful API. It will manage meetup events through basic CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

## Project Structure

Here's a proposed project structure:

```plaintext
meetup-api/
|-- node_modules/
|-- routes/
|   |-- meetups.js
|-- index.js
|-- package.json
```

1. `node_modules/`: This is where the dependencies of the project live.
2. `routes/`: This directory contains route definitions. In this case, we'll have a `meetups.js` file for handling meetup-related routes.
3. `index.js`: This is the entry point of our application where we set up our express application and link it to the routes.
4. `package.json`: This file holds various metadata relevant to the project including its dependencies.

## Components

### Express Application (`index.js`)

This is the core of our application. It sets up the Express.js application and middleware, links to the routes, and starts the server.

### Routes (`routes/meetups.js`)

This component will contain the business logic for handling requests related to meetup events.

## Interactions between Components

The Express Application will use the Routes component to handle all routes starting with `/meetups`. For example, a `GET` request to `/meetups/1` would trigger the read operation in the Routes component for the meetup with ID 1.

## Sequence of Tasks

1. **Setup Node.js Project**: Start by setting up a new Node.js project with npm. This will create a new `package.json` file.

2. **Install Express.js**: Use npm to install Express.js, which will be added to the dependencies in the `package.json` file.

3. **Create Express Application**: In the `index.js` file, set up the Express.js application and middleware.

4. **Implement Routes**: In the `routes/meetups.js` file, implement the business logic for each route:

   - `POST /meetups`: Create a new meetup.
   - `GET /meetups`: Retrieve a list of all meetups.
   - `GET /meetups/:id`: Retrieve details of a specific meetup.
   - `PUT /meetups/:id`: Update a specific meetup.
   - `DELETE /meetups/:id`: Delete a specific meetup.

5. **Link Routes to Express Application**: In the `index.js` file, import the routes and use them in the Express application.

6. **Test the API**: Use a tool like Postman or curl to send requests to the API and confirm that it behaves as expected.

After these tasks are completed, the Meetup API should be fully functional for managing meetup events using an in-memory data store.
