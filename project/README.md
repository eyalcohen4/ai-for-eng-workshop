## Initial Prompt

```
Let's plan a new software project. We're going to build a Meetup API, which is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Express.js on the Node.js platform. The purpose of this API is to manage meetup events.

We need the API to support the following operations:

1. Create a new meetup
2. Retrieve a list of all meetups
3. Retrieve details of a specific meetup by its 'id'
4. Update the details of a specific meetup by its 'id'
5. Delete a specific meetup by its 'id'

For this project, we'll use an in-memory data store (like an array) to keep it simple.

Please draft a planning document outlining the project folder structure, the necessary components, the interactions between these components, and the sequence of tasks we should follow to complete the project.
